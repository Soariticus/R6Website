	<h2 id="amaru">Amaru</h2>
	<img src="att/amaru.jpg" alt="Amaru's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Starting with a difficult one, Amaru isn't even in the game yet, currently, she is only available on the TS (Test Server), I haven't personally played her at all so I can't really state anything much about her. All I know is that for a fact she has a grapple hook, which sounds way better than it is. With it, she can ram through barricaded windows that are above her, or onto the roof quickly. The gadget is a 3(?) time use, and then it becomes useless. The animation also takes long, giving the defenders plenty of time to shoot Amaru out of the sky. <br />
	Whilst as I stated I have not played with Amaru yet. I feel she will be played a ton, simply because of her unique gadget, but I feel she won't be strong in the slightest. She is just going to be there, and not really that strong or much of a threat.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="white">
	<h2 id="ash">Ash</h2>
	<img src="att/ash.jpg" alt="Ash's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>This might be one of the most controversial operators in the game, after losing her ACOG scope a while back, people thought Ash wouldn't be used near as much, this didn't work, and to this day she might just be the most picked operator. Her gadget is pretty good, its pretty much a long-range breach charge. You shoot the gadget, it explodes, and it opens up a hole in the wall. Her gadget isn't what makes Ash so powerful however. What does, is that her gun is probably the best gun in the entire game, the R4C. This gun has incredibly stats, great damage, great fire rate, really good recoil, very acceptable magazine capacity. It's just an all-round great gun, one of, if not the best. <br />
	When I think about good scenarios to pick Ash, nothing really pops up, she gets played every round pretty much, because her gun is just that good. Her gadget, all things considered isn't very strong, it's good and useful, but it's far from strong. Pick Ash if you just want to pop some fools.</p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="blackbeard">Blackbeard</h2>
	<img src="att/blackbeard.jpg" alt="Blackbeard's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Blackbeard used to be really, really, really, overpowered. His shield had 200hp, meaning it would take the same amount of damage to break as it would to kill 2 people. And he had 2 of these shields, meaning before being able to headshot him, you'd have to fully kill 4 people worth of health before you could actually hit the head. Sadly, he got nerfed, a LOT. Currently, he still has 2 shields, both of which have 60hp. However I personally find his biggest nerf to be against his weapons, his AR has a LOT of recoil (to be fair, both of his guns have really good damage, but the recoil of his AR is very hard to control), and his DMR also feels hard to use correctly. Currently I wouldn't suggest using him too much, seen as he is pretty weak now, however if you have good recoil control, and I mean REALLY good recoil control, he is a pretty decent operator.<br />
	When should you use Blackbeard? Well, he's not very situational, his general playstyle would be to walk around crouched to make your body a smaller target to hit, and peek, a LOT(!!!!). With your head being protected by the shield, if you and an enemy start shooting at each other at the same time, chances are you will kill him before he hits you at all, although you should be aware that his shield's hitbox isn't that big and its pretty easy to just shoot blackbeard in the body. The best playstyle to me is just to hold hard angles from windows or holes to make your body as small of a target as possible, to force people to shoot through your shield before they can hit you. This is hard to do however, and will take a lot of time to do properly.</p>

	<section id="white">
	<h2 id="blitz">Blitz</h2>
	<img src="att/blitz.jpg" alt="Blitz's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Blitz, god damned, how I hate this operator. He likely has one of the most annoying gadgets, alongside <a href=#jackal>Jackal</a>. Blitz carries around a shield, which doesn't sound too bad by itself does it? No, but what makes Blitz so annoying is that he has a flashing device inside of his shield, with 4 charges. At the press of a button, Blitz will completely blind anyone looking his direction (like a flashbang) and then rush at them at mach 7 and absolutely destroy them with a melee attack, and its really hard to counter. A very well played Blitz is so strong that it makes it near enough impossible to kill him in a 1v1 situation. You see, with normal shields, the counter to them is to either shoot the feet (they can counter this by crouching however), or wait for them to aim down sights which will allow you to shoot them in the head. The problem with Blitz is however that he never has to put his shield down, he can easily blind you, <b>and then</b> pull out his pistol to easily kill you, or never risk showing his head by just sprinting up to you (BLitz is also the only shield operator that keeps his shield infront of him while sprinting!!!) and melee you, barely giving you a chance to fight back.<br />
	When is a good situation to pick Blitz? Well, As stated before, a well played Blitz is really hard to counter and will easily destroy a team. However if the enemy team has communication, as soon as they spot a Blitz they will scream out and you will be rushed by multiple people, Blitz is not that viable at higher elo. Blitz isn't at all situational, he is great at rushing a team, but if he gets himself into a 2v1 situation, he will usually die easily seen as he can only protect himself from one side at once (the shield isn't that big either). Personally, I'd ask of you NEVER to play Blitz simply because he is so incredibly annoying, but people will anyway.</p>

	<h2 id="buck">Buck</h2>
	<img src="att/buck.jpg" alt="Buck's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Before I start this, let me just get one thing accross, I used to main Buck for a long time, and thus might be a bit biased towards him, but he is a really strong operator in the right situation. Buck's strongest feature is his gadget, a shotgun mounted to the back of his main gun, allowing him to effectively have an AR and a shotgun out at all times, swapping between them takes barely any time at all, sadly the shotgun isn't all that good for actually putting an opponent down, the main feature of it is how great it is at destroying soft surfaces. This allows Buck to be probably the single best operator at playing vertical, on objectives with an entire floor above it, Buck is a very good pick. His guns have some really strong recoil, so I see a lot of people running Buck with holographic sight, however I have gotten used to his recoil so I run him with an ACOG.<br />
	When is a good situation to pick Buck? If there is a chance the objective has a very good vertical play. A lot of objectives have this possibility, so to be fair Buck is useful in a lot of scenarios. After shotgunning out the floor (or ceiling) of a room and you can look into objective, quickly scan the area to see if you can get any quick and easy kills, if this is not the case, make sure to check entrances to the room you are in for about 30 seconds as a roamer is likely on his way to come and kill you. If this is not the case, or if you have killed the roamer, in most cases, in about 10-15 seconds the defending team will forget about the holes in the floor or ceiling, so return back to your holes and try and get some quick kills, repeat this cycle the entire game through (assuming you're not the last one standing and you aren't required to help make a push), check your flank, check your holes. This leaves a lot of pressure onto the anchors and anyone else in objective and makes it more likely they make a mistake and you or your team can get a quick and easy kill.</p>

	<h2 id="capitao">Capitao</h2>
	<img src="att/capitao.jpg" alt="Capitao's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Capitao, wow, what a journey this man has had. He started out as a very weak operator. His gadget is a crossbow that can fire either flame arrows which leave a little flame pool on the floor for a couple of seconds which do damage pretty much denying the area for anyone to pass, he can also fire smoke darts which leave a (smaller than smoke grenades) smoke cloud which you cannot see through. At launch, this was really weak. The fire wasn't that deadly, kills with it were very rare, the smoke was useful, sure, but it is a main gadget, instead you could look at <a href="#dokkaebi">Dokkaebi</a>, who has smokes as a secondary gadget, but still has that gadget of hers. A little while ago, however, Capitao got a pretty big buff, the fire radius got increased a lot, making it a lot more lethal and better at area denial. He also got a special ACOG sight for his LMG, the same one as <a href="#gridlock">Gridlock</a>, it might be the best sight in the entire game in my eyes. This made Capitao a lot more valuable.<br />
	When should you use Capitao? Capitao is most commonly used as a prevention of bandit tricking on some maps, however for the average player, this isn't really something to worry about. Personally I find Capitao to be pretty mediocre, and <a href="#gridlock">Gridlock</a> to be a much better character than him, she has a better gadget, but still the same gun with the really good sight.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="dokkaebi">Dokkaebi</h2>
	<img src="att/dokkaebi.jpg" alt="Dokkaebi's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Dokkaebi is a thicc hacker girl rocking some sexy ass yoga pants. I find her to be quite a decent operator, in most of these descriptions I don't mention the guns, but here I find its needed, Dokkaebi has 2 options, she has a DMR and a shotgun, the DMR is very good, use it with an angled grip and an ACOG, I suggest using the DMR 100% of the time. However we can't skip over the shotgun she possesses, the BOSG. This absolute unit of a gun is such a meme-gun that its absolutely amazing. It has the ability to 1-shot-down anyone at most ranges. It's a slug shotgun (meaning it shoots 1 thicc pallet instead of 12 minor ones) which flies straight ahead making it pretty much a reskinned sniper rifle, it only has 2 shots too, so it's hard to really get kills with, but when you do, oh my god does it feel good!! As for her gadget, it's decent, she can call the defending team which will make a very loud and obvious buzzing noise until they shut off the phone. Whilst the phone is buzzing, it's really easy to locate and pre-fire enemies, her other ability is that after a defender dies, they drop a phone passively (whenever she's on the attacking team), she can then hack this phone to give the attacking team access to the defender cameras, which is pretty strong if you have a well-communicating team. <br />
	When should you use Dokkaebi? I find myself falling back onto her if I feel I need to play slow and methodical, with her DMR she is great at killing at VERY long ranges. I tend to stay outside until I get a confirmed kill or a confirmed location on an enemy. When this happens, I go there, if needed kill said enemy and then hack the defender cameras. Once you've done this, you've already completed the first step in being a useful teammate. Make sure to call the enemy if you're pushing, and call this out to your team, this will make it easy for rushers (such as <a href="#ash">Ash</a>) to prefire the exact area where an enemy is located and pick up an easy kill.</p>

	<section id="white">
	<h2 id="finka">Finka</h2>
	<img src="att/finka.jpg" alt="Finka's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Finka is a majorly undervalued operator, she is really strong. At the press of a button, she will empower her entire team with a couple things; Effectively 0 recoil, +20hp (temporarily, however if the player is already under 20hp they will get set to 20hp) and instantly revive any downed team members. This comes at the cost of 2 debuffs, the operator <a href="DfndOps.html/#smoke">Smoke</a>'s gadget will do its damage in quicker succession (increased rate of breathing) and operator <a href="DfndOps.html/#pulse">Pulse</a>'s gadget will give the location of the attackers in quicker succession (increased rate of heartbeats). There is no way for the defending team to recognize when the gadget has been used however, making it easy to catch someone off guard with Finka's LMG around a corner which will shoot like a laser gun now that it has effectively no recoil. The only other downside to this I have noticed is when I get Finka boosted while I'm shooting at an enemy my gun will then go downwards (because I am moving my mouse down to compensate for recoil, which will then no longer be there). This has gotten me killed on one occassion, but usually the +20hp does make it so you can still kill them before they can kill you, assuming you can fix your aim quickly enough.<br />
	When should you use Finka? She is always useful in my experience, her downsides are completely negligable when you put them next to the benefits of having her on your team. The only thing you need to keep in mind as Finka is that if you die, you can no longer boost your team, don't play aggressive until you have used all 3 of your charges in your gadget. Also, please, do be attentive to teammates going down, a cross-map revive on someone can turn the tide of battle. I personally don't use her much, but I do find the LMG to be my personal favorite on her.</p>

	<h2 id="fuze">Fuze</h2>
	<img src="att/fuze.jpg" alt="Fuze's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Fuze is pretty much just a meme. If you're playing hostage, you pick Fuze and you use his gadget to kill the hostage. His hostage is deployed like a breach charge on a soft wall, window or door. Then when it is activated it will fire 5 "grenade" type things from left to right, which do a decent job of clearing out a room, however most people are attentive enough to notice the very easy to recognize noise when the gadget is activated and will then GTFO. Mixing Fuze with <a href="#lion">Lion</a> works really well though when using his gadget on the objective room, as the anchors will have to run to somewhere to prevent getting killed by Fuze, at which point <a href="#lion">Lion</a>'s scan will scan them and make them easy to shoot through a wall, although this is one of the only cases in which Fuze is properly useful.<br />
	When should you use Fuze? Unless you're playing at very low skill level, don't.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="white">
	<h2 id="glaz">Glaz</h2>
	<img src="att/glaz.jpg" alt="Glaz's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Glaz is a sniper with a thermal scope. He used to be quite strong, as soon as he aimed down his sights, he would be able to easily spot enemies and take them down in 2-4 shots. Now, however, he has been slightly nerfed, turning him more into a true sniper instead of a rusher. Now, to activate the thermal, you have to stand still for a second, and once you start moving, the thermal slowly starts to become less powerful making it harder to spot enemies with it. I've personally never been a fan of him, even less now that he has been nerfed this hard.<br />
	When should you use Glaz? There are very few situations in whih Glaz is useful. Generally, don't use him seen as he is incredibly weak now after his nerf.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="gridlock">Gridlock</h2>
	<img src="att/gridlock.jpg" alt="Gridlock's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Gridlock, the thicc'est girl in the game. Gridlock is the only 1 speed attacker that doesn't have a shield, but she makes up for it with her amazing gun, the exact same one as <a href="#capitao">Capitao</a>. Her LMG is slightly different, it has fewer bullets in the magazine, but reloads a lot faster, in this sense, her gun is even stronger than <a href="#Captiao">Capitao</a>'s. Her gadget is probably the best attacking area denial gadget. She can throw out 3 spiked balls, which then spread out into a huge area, <b>defenders</b>that walk over this take damage, whilst attackers are immune to its damage. It is really good for area of denial. <br />
	When should you use Gridlock? She's pretty strong overall, generally, I try and wait to use my gadgets until I get to the objective, trying to block off a core rotation on objective, or an entrance to objective is very powerful. Especially on bomb after you've planted the bomb, litter the entire room with her gadget and it will be very tough for the defenders to defuse it. Keep in mind though, that the spikes can be destroyed by a single melee or shot, they don't take much to destroy, but the sheer quantity makes it strong.</p>

	<section id="white">
	<h2 id="hibana">Hibana</h2>
	<img src="att/hibana.jpg" alt="Hibana's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Hibana is one of three hard breachers, along with <a href="#thermite">Thermite</a> and <a href="#Maverick">Maverick</a> making her a very valuable operator to bring to the field. (hard breaching simply means being able to destroy <b>reinforced</b> walls.) She is the only one of the three that can do this at a range, but second most effective. She can shoot 3 pellets that she can remotely detonate, take a second to blow up, and then destroy the wall or hatch. It will make a hole big enough to go prone through, but if you put all 3 above one another, you can run through it, 2 above one another can be crouched through. Usually people will blow open a wall crouch height and use it to try and get some kills on the other side of the wall. This works pretty well.<br />
	When should you use Hibana? You should use Hibana when there is no other hard breacher on the team yet, but she still works very well alongside <a href="#thermite">Thermite</a>, seen as in this case, Hibana can make 3 holes that can be shot through, or open 3 hatches, whislt <a href="thermite">Thermite</a> will open up reinforced walls leading into objective. <a href="#maverick">Maverick</a> works less well alongside her, seen as he generally uses his gadget to make very small holes in reinforced walls to peek through and get kills, whilst Hibana kind of does the same thing. However, if neither of these are on your team, I generally use 1 shot to open up a peek hole to shoot through, and the leftover 2 to make a crouch high hole into objective so we get more easy access into objective.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="iq">IQ</h2>
	<img src="att/iq.jpg" alt="IQ's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>IQ is pretty average all around. She has decent guns, and a decent objective, the only thing that's absolutely great about her is that <b><i><u>ASS!!</u></i></b> Okay, memes aside, she's pretty average. Her gadget is very mediocre, it can scan pretty much everything that would logically run on batteries and is from the defenders. If it doesn't run on batteries, she won't see it. Her gadget has a range of 20m and while you have it out, you are limited to your secondary weapon.<br />
	When should you use IQ? IQ is very strong if the enemy team is using a lot of trap operators, <a href="DfndOps.html/#lesion">Lesion</a> and <a href="DfndOps.html/#kapkan">Kapkan</a>, for example. Sadly, she will see them, but before you can get anywhere near them, your friendly neighborhood <a href="#ash">Ash</a> will have probably already disabled them by rushing straight through them and getting herself killed. Her gadget simply doesn't offer that much because of the amount of time it takes for IQ to properly go and take out the gadgets she finds, unless your team is communcating a lot and you can call out accurate locations on the gadgets, she simply isn't worth bringing.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="white">
	<h2 id="jackal">Jackal</h2>
	<img src="att/jackal.jpg" alt="Jackal's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Jackal, this guy is really annoying too, just like <a href="#blitz">Blitz</a>, he truly is. Jackal's ability allows him to see footprints all over the map where defenders have left them. This gives him a good idea of where the defenders have been, the color of the footprints also indicates how long it has been there. This is based off thermal colors (red is warmest, thus has been left there the least long ago, blue is coldest, thus has been left there the longest). The footprints fully disappear after 90 seconds. This means if Jackal enters a room and sees red footprints, he knows an enemy has got to be near. All operators can prevent their footprints from being left by going prone around the map, this is the only way to not leave footprints. Except for <a href="DfndOps.html/#caveira">Caveira</a>, who can use her ability and while it is active will not leave any footprints. This, however, is not the only thing Jackal can do, Jackal can also scan the footprints, at which case the defender will get his position pinged, this can be done a total of 3 times. Jackal combos really well with <a href="#lion">Lion</a>, after Jackal scans someones footsteps, <a href="#lion">Lion</a> will then scan, and force the scanned defender to either move and get pinged by <a href="#lion">Lion</a>, or stand still and get pinged by Jackal. Jackal's ping's are for a duration of 20 seconds, and will re-ping every 5 seconds updating the attackers to the location of the defender. <br />
	When should you use Jackal? There's a reason he has the highest ban rate in ranked, he is bloody annoying to play against, his pinging is incredibly stressfull and will force people to rush back to objective immediately 9/10 times. I don't really play Jackal seen as he is 97% banrate in ranked, meaning even if you get good at him, you will barely ever be able to use him in ranked.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="lion">Lion</h2>
	<img src="att/lion.jpg" alt="Lion's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Lion, was incredibly overpowered at launch, now, but a shadow of its former self. Lion's gadget is a map-wide scan, this scan lasts about 3 seconds, if, during any of these 3 seconds, a defender moves, they get pinged. At launch, this "ping" would be a full view of the defenders body through walls, it was pretty much like having wall-hacks, resulting in a lot of very cheeky wallbangs. Now, the ping is a normal ping, as if the defender got scanned by a camera, the logo is slightly different though so you know that its from a Lion scan, and the ping will move with the defender that has moved for the duration of the scan. It is important to note that once you start moving and you get pinged, you will stay pinged even if you then stand still.<br />
	When should you use Lion? Lion is pretty weak now, I don't really play him all that often so I'm not too good at giving tips for him, I know his V308 Spear (its a gun) is pretty good, and I know his gadget can still be strong if used correctly, as on how to use his gadget, I can't really say because I never use him, and no one plays him anymore so I never really see him played at all anymore.  </p>
	</section>

	<section id="white">
	<h2 id="maverick">Maverick</h2>
	<img src="att/maverick.jpg" alt="Maverick's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Maverick, the newest hardbreacher to come to the aid of the attackers. Maverick is perhaps the best at getting cheeky kills, but the worst at his actual duty of a hard-breacher. He has a blowtorch which can burn small holes in reinforced walls. Sadly, it takes quite some time to make a hole big enough for the attackers to fit through. It is because of this that Maverick is mostly seen going to a wall next to or near objective, burning a small hole in it and peeking into objective trying to get some cheeky kills.<br />
	When should you use Maverick? He can be used as a last resort hard-breacher, but I wouldn't recommend it. He is more of a fragger than he is a hard-breacher. Use him accordingly. </p>
	</section>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="montagne">Montagne</h2>
	<img src="att/montagne.jpg" alt="Montagne's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Montagne, the chunky boi. A force to be reckoned with on a well coordinated team. Almost useless in a 1v1 situation however. Montagne has the ability to enlarge his shield so it fully covers his body, toe to head, even some above his head, and from a decent angle to the side, this makes it very difficult to kill him, Nitro Cells are advised to do so. Generally a Montagne will enter a room first, and look around for enemies, if he sees an enemy, he will put a ping on said enemy which the rest of his team will then follow up on and kill the enemy. If you're gonna play Montagne, make sure to communicate a lot, and make sure there is always someone behind you to kill the enemy. It is also important to note that unlike normal shields, Montagne's shield cannot be melee'd to the side, if you block someone in a room, they're stuck. This also counts for the defuser, if you plant it in a corner and stand on it as Montagne, it is impossible to break the defuser, or to kill Montagne (unless he is standing infront of a soft wall or you have explosives)<br />
	When should you use Montagne? I can't stress this enough, only use him if you have a coordinating team, and you yourself are willing to coordinate with them. Without this, Montagne is just a free kill for the enemy team. Further than this I can't give too much advise seen as he does not fit my playstyle at all so I never play him. </p>

	<h2 id="nomad">Nomad</h2>
	<img src="att/nomad.jpg" alt="Nomad's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Nomad, I love this one. Nomad has 3 airjabs, these are things she can shoot from her gun which, when an enemy comes too close, will knock them back with a loud noise. This will immediately alert you that one of your airjabs has gone up, and leave the enemy on the ground stunned for a second before they can do anything. There are some really cool things you can do with this, if you set it up right, you can knock an enemy into a claymore placed by one of your teammates, it's great fun. It's important to note that it's one of the only gadgets that once placed down, <b>cannot be picked back up and reused</b>.<br />
	I find that playing Nomad as an anti-roamer makes her very useful. She can hold down entire areas on her own without problems, because she can cover her flanks with the airjabs. It is also very strong to use this on bomb, place the airjabs near the defuser, and one inside/next to the defuser, when the enemies come to defuse it, they get knocked back costing them valuable time.</p>

	<h2 id="nokk">Nokk</h2>

	<p>Nokk, a very new addition to the R6 roster. Her gadget is a weird one, it kind of works like <a href="DfndOps.html/#Caveira">Caveira</a>, it makes it so she can't be seen on cameras, but if you know what you're looking for you can still see her on the cameras, however she will not be able to get tagged. It also makes her footsteps <b>less loud</b> note that it doesn't make them fully quiet like <a href="DfndOps.html/#caveira">Caveira</a>'s gadget does.
	When should you use Nokk? This is a tough question, I don't see her being very strong in any way, her only really useful gun is the FMG9, which is a defender weapon and as such it does little damage, it has effectively not recoil however which is great, but with its shitty damage its not the best. Her gadget is also quite mediocre, overall, she's mediocre. This doesn't mean I don't like playing with her, it's just that theres not really a strategy to it. I tend to just kinda flank the enemy team, making use of my invisibility to cameras, but that doesn't fully work, because as I stated, it makes you hard to spot, but not to someone that knows what they're looking for. It's a weird situation she's in, if she were truly invisible she would be a lot stronger and would be probably the best flanking operator, but as of right now, she's kind of mediocre.</p>

	<h2 id="sledge">Sledge</h2>
	<img src="att/sledge.jpg" alt="Sledge's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Sledge is the Rainbow Six: Siege equivalent of Shrek. Play the start of "All star" over and over again and you will be fine. Sledge carries a sledgehammer that he can use to break crouch-sized holes in soft walls. He is very good at playing vertical like <a href="#buck">Buck</a>, but he can't play upwards because his sledgehammer is obviously melee. He is really good though overall, his guns are pretty good, his gadget is pretty good at making rotations, all around, he's pretty good.<br />
	When should you use Sledge? When <a href="#buck">Buck</a> isn't available. In my humble opinion, <a href="#buck">Buck</a> is in every way better than Sledge. His breaching tool is superior, his weapons do more damage, although it could be argued Sledge's recoil is a lot better and that balances it out. Simply put, <a href="#buck">Buck</a> is Sledge2.0.</p>

	<h2 id="thatcher">Thatcher</h2>
	<img src="att/thatcher.jpg" alt="Thatcher's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Thatcher, Rainbow Six: Siege's very own anti-tech grandpa. Hates everything electronic, unmanned drones, fokin laser soights!!!! He has an EMP-grenade. 4 of them in fact. What these do, is, through walls and any other surface, in a certain radius, they destroy everything with a battery in it. If <a href="#iq">IQ</a> can spot it, Thatcher can blow it up. <br />
	If you have a <a href="#thermite">Thermite</a> on your team, you need an angry grandpa. They're like lovers, you can't seperate them, hell, not even this list could, <a href="#thermite">Thermite</a> is the next one on this list (to be fair, I don't have much say over the order seen as I just put it in alphabetical order but you know). As Thatcher, stick to <a href="#thermite">Thermite</a> like he's your son. Don't leave him alone, if <a href="#thermite">Thermite</a> wants to blow up a wall, you throw your EMP near the wall first so the car batteries and mute jammers get destroyed and thermite can safely blow the wall to pieces.</p>

	<h2 id="thermite">Thermite</h2>
	<img src="att/thermite.jpg" alt="Thermite's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Thermite, this guy loves explosives almost as much as Michael Bay. He is probably the single best Hard Breacher in the game. He has 2 exothermic charges, advanced breach charges that can destroy reinforced walls. They make a huge hole that the player can easily run through. You pretty much always need a Thermite, on every map, on most objectives. If theres a chance you need reinforced walls gone, Thermite's your man. Him, along with his grandpa <a href="#thatcher">Thatcher</a> will take care of those pesky walls.<br />
	Everyone in the community agrees that Thermite and <a href="#thatcher">Thatcher</a> belong together. I have noted in the description of <a href="#thatcher">Thatcher</a> that you should stick to your Thermite at all times, while this is true, this doesn't mean the Thermite doesn't have to pay any attention to his grandpa. It's often pretty hard to stick to Thermite when you're getting shot at from all sides and Thermite decided to spawn on the other side of the map last second, don't be that guy, help your grandpa be there for you, he just wants to help you out, accept it. </p>

	<h2 id="twitch">Twitch</h2>
	<img src="att/twitch.jpg" alt="Twitch's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Twitch's ability is being Rich, in fact, she's so rich, she wants to show it off so much, she had to 1-up everyone on the drone. Twitch has a taser inside her drone, with this she can zap pretty much everything with a battery and break it. Along with her having the (what I consider to be) number 2 best weapon in the game, the F2, she is a really strong operator if the droning is good. If you are decent at destroying the right things and not wasting your drones, you're doing your job as a Twitch, if you're getting kills with her gun, good, but don't make it your main focus, don't forget, what else is <a href="#ash">Ash</a> supposed to do if she can't even kill people?<br />
	When should you use Twitch? She's a pretty good replacement for <a href="#thatcher">Thatcher</a> generally, although <a href="#thatcher">Thatcher</a> is still the best man for the job. Just don't play aggressive until you have used both of your drones, and preferably all 10 shock darts in them, and you're good.</p>

	<p>Ying likes to take people's pictures, but has fancy glasses that make her able to see. Ying has the zappy bling blangs, they're advanced flash bangs, nuff said, she has a decent LMG that pairs well with her rushing into a room after flashing it, but flashbangs don't work in siege so I'm not even gonna talk about Ying anymore. </p>

	<h2 id="zofia">Zofia</h2>
	<img src="att/zofia.jpg" alt="Zofia's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Lastly, my favorite girl and my current main, Zofia, aka Zofie. She has a fancy grenade launcher that is better than <a href="#ash">Ash</a>'s in every way shape and form. It has 2 impact grenades in it, they detonate on, well, impact. This makes them very good for surprising enemies, it's also fairly quiet, especially if you have one of your friends shoot randomly to make the sound quiet and actually scare your enemies so bad they want to shoot themselves.	On a more serious note, this is absolutely perfect for opening up a soft wall randomly to surprise an enemy and shoot them, you have the advantage, you're already lookin in that direction, all you have to do is aim and shoot, they will still have to take time to realise what the hell just happened before they can react to it. Best part is, that isn't even the full gadget, it's only halve! The other option is that you can also shoot concussion grenades that explode as soon as they get within about 2 meters from a defender, or if it is out too long, it will bounce off of walls if no defender is nearby to detonate it. Shooting this around a corner and listening, if it explodes faster than it should, there's an enemy in there, it's pretty much 2 extra drones! Apart from this, they also get stunned which makes it a lot harder for them to aim and hit the shots on you! It's absolutely wonderful! But, we're still not done, she has one last ability! If Zofia gets downed, she can actually <b>revive herself</b>! This will leave her at 1hp, but 1hp and up is better than 0hp and downed, nothing hurts more than downing an enemy Zofia, just for her to get back up and then kill you. It's hard to pull off, and you barely ever actually get to revive yourself, but when you do, it feels great!<br />
	When should you use Zofia? Never, absolutely never, not if I'm on your team with you anyway, if I'm not. You should use her in replacement of <a href="#ash">Ash</a> and <a href="#buck">Buck</a>, she is a very good fragger, and also very good at playing vertical, bring breach charges and you can open up 5 seperate soft walls, 2 from your impacts, and 3 from your breach charges, her gun is also INCREDIBLY good, easy to control, good damage, good ammo capacity, good rate of fire, it's absolutely great.   </p>
