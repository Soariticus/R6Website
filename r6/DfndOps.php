  	<h1>Defending Operators</h1>

	<section id="full">
	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="alibi">Alibi</h2>
	<img src="def/alibi.jpg" alt="Alibi's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Alibi, the magician. Alibi has the ability to put down 3 holograms that look exactly identical to her, when these are shot, melee'd, passed through by a player or a drone, the player will get pinged much like a jackal ping. Most people won't fall for the hologram itself, but will just shoot because they see something that looks like an enemy, and as a result get themselves tagged which will be an easy kill.<br />
	When should you use Alibi? Alibi is most effective if you notice the enemy team usually only pushes into objective in the last halve a minute or so, at this point there will be stress, and they are most likely to shoot the decoys, when this happens, your team is alerted to the position of the enemies and will be easy to block off from objective or kill outright. If the enemy team tends to rush objective, Alibi won't be anywhere near as useful. </p>
 	</section>

	<h2 id="bandit">Bandit</h2>
	<img src="def/bandit.jpg" alt="Bandit's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Bandito dorito, known for his amazing gun. The MP7 is ran by most people on ironsights, it is the only gun that people pick ironsights for on purpose. The ironsights are absolutely amazing on it and I recommend you give it a try if you ever use Bandit. His gadget is easy to use, after that his gun is quite good at getting kills.<br />
	When should you use Bandit? On objectives where keeping a reinforced wall safe is high priority. Place down the batteries on the reinforcement, and run off and roam, easy enough. </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="castle">Castle</h2>
	<img src="def/castle.jpg" alt="Castle's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Castle, the one that gets your team killed more than he does the enemy. Castle's ability is an advanced barricade that he can place on windows and doors. These take not 3 melee hits but 12 to destroy, and cannot be shot open (apart from <a href="AttckOps.html/#glaz">Glaz</a>). They also take about 3x as long to destroy by holding F on them, destroying them by interacting with them puts them back into Castle's inventory to re-use, no matter who does it and no matter how far Castle is away from the barricade, he has 3 of these he can place down. The problem with this is that most Castle's will barricade all entrances into objective, this is a bad idea. It means it will be very hard for defenders to quickly get back into objective, and <a href="AttckOps.html/#fuze">Fuze</a> can easily place one of his charges on the barricade and (mostly) safely nuke the entire objective room, and since the other entrances are also blocked off, the defenders can't even run away from it usually resulting in death. The proper way to use them would be to force choke-points or force the attackers to take a certain path, but even when used "properly" like that, most attacking operators have a way of easily dealing with it, any explosion will destroy it. <br />
	When should you use Castle? Unless your entire team has agreed to a strat that requires Castle, don't. There is one exception to this off the top of my head, which is Oregon top floor objective, in which Castle should block off both windows in kids room, and the big window, although even this is debateable seen as attackers can easily destroy it, and a lot of defenders like to hold an angle outside from the main window. </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="caveira">Caveira</h2>
	<img src="def/caveira.jpg" alt="Caveira's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Caveira, the molestor. Caveira is a very good roamer, among the best, her ability allows her to completely silently move around the map. When activating, she will be forced to hold her pistol (which you should have out anyway since you're Cav) and will make no more noise, this effect lasts about 7 seconds, after which it will have to recharge before being usable again. Her pistol got a nerf very recently, it used to do 99 damage per shot(!!) for ranges up to about 9 meters, meaning it would always 2-shot down (unless you're sniping with it), now, it has been slightly nerfed and it will take some more shots to down someone. The pistol is also a guaranteed downed but not out, and will not kill outright except for a couple instances; if the attacker has already been downed once, it will result in a kill. If the defender is grappling, it will result in a kill. Off the top of my head these are the only 2 situations in which the pistol will kill, and not down the opponent. A downed opponent can be interrogated by Caveira, she will walk up to the attacker and interact with it, after a short duration the location of all attackers will be fully revealed, one interrogation can completely win your team the game.<br />
	When should you use Caveira? If you like roaming a lot, and know how to flank and make use of her silent step. Don't get greedy with the interrogations and you should be fine, have your pistol out at all times (unless theres only 1 attacker left alive, or if you are fighting multiple people at once.) </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="clash">Clash</h2>
	<img src="def/clash.jpg" alt="Clash's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Clash, the angry black woman. Clash has a shield with a taser inside of it. This taser can be fired from an extreme distance away, and will slow down the enemy majorly whilst dealing damage, while this taser is being used it will drain charge, charge will passively regenerate while not in use. Her shield is a lot alike with <a href="AttckOps.html/#montagne">Montagne</a>, as in it fully blocks off the body, unlike <a href="AttckOps.html/#montagne">Montagne</a>'s shield, however, it can be melee'd away.<br />
	When should you use Clash? When you really want to piss off the enemy, a lot. Clash is extremely annoying to play against, but also pretty easy to counter, get close, melee her shield away and you can easily kill her. Try teaming up against her whenever possible. It should be noted however she is banned a lot in ranked so if you main her, you should probably find someone else to play for ranked. </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="doc">Doc</h2>
	<img src="def/doc.jpg" alt="Doc's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Doc, one of the two thicc boys of the defending team. Doc is the hardest to play out of the two Thicc boys, <a href="#rook">Rook</a>'s ability can be placed down at the start of the prep phase, while for best usage of Doc's gadget, he has to stay alive. He has a stim pistol, which has 3 bullets to fire. These bullets will heal teammates or himself by 40hp. They can also be used to pick up a downed player from long range (this also works on attackers!) too. <br />
	When should you use Doc? If you wanna play one of the thicc boys which are among the best anchors in the game, I'd recommend you instead use <a href="#rook">Rook</a>, seen as it doesn't matter if he dies within the first 10 seconds, his ability is passive, not active. Doc however will have to remain alive, and remain very vigilant to make good usage of his gadget. </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="echo">Echo</h2>
	<img src="def/echo.jpg" alt="Echo's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Echo, the lazy nerd. Echo has 2 yokai drones, these can be either on the floor or the ceiling, they can move around freely like normal drones can on the floor, however whilst they're on the roof they will be stuck in place, and can only move after going back down to the floor. After attaching onto the ceiling, they can fire out 3 concussion shots. These have a small AOE which will majorly concuss the players hit by them, friendly fire is enabled on this. The faster a player moves, the worse the effect will be (worst for sprinting, best for standing still). The drones will also cloak after being on the roof for a couple seconds. The last benefit Echo has is being the only one whose phone will not start buzzing after <a href="AttckOps.html/dokkaebi">Dokkaebi</a> has called him, due to being in a relationship with her in the past or something like that? <br />
	When should you use Echo? Echo is a pretty decent replacement for <a href="#rook">Rook</a> and <a href="#doc">Doc</a>. Echo generally goes prone in one room and stays on his drones for the entire game, calling out the locations of pushing attackers and stunning them before the defending team gets into an engagement with them. Then when it comes close to the final push, echo will finally peek his head out and use his ACOG to get some kills. </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="ela">Ela</h2>
	<img src="def/ela.jpg" alt="Ela's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Ela, the punk rock girl with a great ass. Like her sister, <a href="AttckOps.html/#zofia">Zofia</a>, she really likes concussing people. Ela does this with her traps which stick to any surface and when neared, cause a stunning effect. Ela used to be the best defender in the game, her gun had 51 bullets, and was a bloody laser gun. Now, her gun has a LOT of recoil, and as such, is no longer used all that much. <br />
	When should you use Ela? Don't. Unless you can get used to her insane recoil, it's not worth bringing her over a roamer such as <a href="#jager">Jager</a> or <a href="#bandit">Bandit</a>. </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="Frost">Frost</h2>
	<img src="def/frost.jpg" alt="Frost's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Frost, the trap. Her gadget is a bear trap that she can place 3 of on the map. When an attacker walks into these they will get instant downed (this does not count towards the total of 1 DBNO (downed but not out) that people can reach before they get killed. You can get clapped by all 3 bear traps and still go down before fully dieing.), there is as of right now not a single operator that can get out of this by themselves and help from a teammate to get out of it is always required. Her gun (9mm primary) is quite a good gun, very good recoil, and very good damage, the only thing it lacks in is its fire-rate. <br />
	When should you use Frost? She usually works, but I would recommend against picking her every single round, do it once, maybe twice, more than that and people will start to be very vigilant and watch out for them. </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="goyo">Goyo</h2>
	<img src="def/goyo.jpg" alt="Goyo's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Goyo, the newest operator along with <a href="AttckOps.html/#amaru">Amaru</a>. This operator I also have not played seen as I haven't even installed the TS. I also don't know much about him, the only thing I can say for sure is that his trap is a deployable shield (similar to the secondary gadget a couple operators have), he has 3 of these and they have an exploding canister on the back. When this canister is shot (attacker or defender) it will explode and leave an area of fire in the area for a while. This is all I really know about this operator. </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="jager">Jager</h2>
	<img src="def/jager.jpg" alt="Jager's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Jager, Rainbow Six's very own toxic boy. This one is a personal favorite of mine, I main him along with <a href="AttckOps.html/#zofia">Zofia</a>. He is the only defender with an AR and as such is very lethal. Jager used to be known for his spawn-peeking, Ubisoft fixed this by taking away his ACOG, now, he is a top tier roamer. His gadget are ADS's, 3 devices he can place down on the floor or a wall, which will snipe 3 throwables (attacker thrown) out of the air each. This gives you a safety net for 3/5 pellets from a <a href="AttckOps.html/#fuze">Fuze</a> charge each. Or a total of 9 throwables that will be destroyed as soon as they enter the ADS's sight. This means stun-grenades can't pass, normal grenades can't, smoke grenades, and even <a href="AttckOps.html/#thatcher">Thatcher</a>'s EMP grenades won't be able to pass (although they can still destroy the ADS if throw on the other side of the wall seen as the ADS can't shoot through the wall while the EMP effect does go through walls).<br />
	When should you play Jager? You should play Jager whenever, he's always a good pick for a roamer. I don't think I have to say much more, pick barbed wire, place down your gadgets, barbed wire, and if needed, your reinforcements, and go ham. </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="kaid">Kaid</h2>
	<img src="def/kaid.jpg" alt="Kaid's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Kaid, <a href="#bandit">Bandit</a>'s replacement. Kaid's gadget is a claw that he can throw onto any surface to electrify anything in its range. This means he could get 2 reinforcements electrified from one claw, or even electrify a hatch from the bottom. He has 2 weapons, an AUG (a mediocre SMG), and a DMR-shotgun. Like the BOSG, it fires slugs meaning it can be used long-range, most people run it with an ACOG and use it as a DMR. It can however be used to destroy soft surfaces.<br />
	When should you use Kaid? You should use Kaid if Bandit isn't available due to a ban, or if you really need to reinforce a hatch (oregon basement is a good example). </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="kapkan">Kapkan</h2>
	<img src="def/kapkan.jpg" alt="Kapkan's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Kapkan, the guy that hides all game long and still manages to do something for his team. Kapkan can place down several traps, he can arm these on doorframes or windowframes. When the doorframe or windowframe is passed, the trap will go off and explode dealing 60 damage. This has the ability to down an attacker, or to kill them outright, depending on their HP when they walk into the trap. If their hp is above 60 however, it will just subtract 60 hp and leave the attacker alive. <br />
	When should you use Kapkan? Kapkan is great for winning your team time. Once players start to figure out there is a kapkan on the other team, they will spend time checking every doorframe and window before passing through it, winning you a lot of time. As a kapkan, pick his SMG (it has no recoil and is a headshot machine), place your traps on random doors/windows, and anchor. Roaming can also work if you can use the sound of explosions to your advantage, but his 2 speed 2 armor means you should stay close to objective while roaming.</p>
	</section>
	
	<h2 id="lesion">Lesion</h2>
	<img src="def/lesion.jpg" alt="Lesion's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Lesion, the prick. Lesion has GU mines, he starts the game with one, every 30 seconds he is alive, he will get one extra up to a total of 7 over the entire round. Once throw down, they will cloak making them very hard to spot for everyone except <a href="AttckOps.html/#iq">IQ</a>. Once a player enters its range, they will take some damage, and then tick damage every 2-3 seconds. The damage isn't much, but it adds up. This effect will continue until the player removes the needle by holding the activate button.<br />
	When should you use Lesion? Whenever, he is a great roamer because he can easily use his GU mines to figure out where people are. He works best against a team that rushes, seen as his GU mines can heavily slow down a player. It is however important to note that since his needles regenerate he should try to stay alive as long as possible, which is why anchoring works really well for him too. I personally prefer to roam with him and use the GU's as indicators of where people are, but this is purely personal preference.</p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="Maestro">Maestro</h2>
	<img src="def/maestro.jpg" alt="Maestro's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Maestro, the guy with the big gun. Maestro is the only defender with an LMG. He has 2 evil eyes, cameras that can only be destroyed by explosions, or shooting it in the lens when it opens its covers. When Maestro uses these cameras, he can turn them 360 degrees, and see thermal. While holding aim down button it will open its lens and be available to be shot out, but the camera can also fire laser beams which have infinite range and are hitscan which fire in quite quick succession. These do 5 damage each, after shooting for a certain amount of time, the camera can overheat, at which point it will have to stop being used to cool back down.<br />
	When should you use Maestro? I don't play Maestro, so instead I got a good friend of mine to write this, he has played a ton of Maestro and as such will be able to explain this better than I will--- Maestro is a good area denier/plant denier by spamming his zapper  just like Lesion. He's also good at collecting intel considering his camera works just like a normal camera if he's dead so he's still usefull if he's place both his cameras and went of to fuck all and die at the beginning of the round. if you know how to use him/if you know where to place your cameras he'll be even better. He is however still good if all his cameras as he has a gun that has alot of bullets and recoil, so slap an acog on that bad boy and hope for the best if you're all out of cameras.  </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="mira">Mira</h2>
	<img src="def/mira.jpg" alt="Mira's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Mira, the WindowsXP user. Mira can place down 2 windows, these windows can only be seen through from one side, and are fully bulletproof. On the side that can be seen through there is a small canister, if you shoot this canister or melee it, the window will drop and the window will instead turn into a kill-hole.<br />
	When should you use Mira? Mira is very situational, she only works on certain maps with a certain strategy, if you are reading this and are genuinely trying to learn from it, it'd be best for you to stay away from Mira until you know when and how you should use her. When used improperly she can be more negative to the team than positive. </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="mozzie">Mozzie</h2>
	<img src="def/mozzie.jpg" alt="Mozzie's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Mozzie, the tiny man. Mozzie being from Australia means he obviously has to have something with spiders, so he does. Mozzie has 3 mechanical spiders that he can shoot onto any surface. Any drones passing through the range of these spiders will get latched onto (only one drone per spider), after this has happened, the drone now belongs to Mozzie, who can control the drone and use it to get intel for the defenders. A very cool idea in my opinion. </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="mute">Mute</h2>
	<img src="def/mute.jpg" alt="Mute's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Mute, the, well, Mute. Mute isn't actually as mute as his name would imply. He does talk, just, barely. His gadget is a short-range signal jammer. He can place a couple of these down, anything electronic that is in its range will become useless. This counts for drones, <a href="AttckOps.html/#hibana">Hibana</a>'s pellets, breach charges, and everything like those, if it is activated by a remote signal, it will not work. This makes mute a decent replacement for <a href="#bandit">Bandit</a> and <a href="#kaid">Kaid</a>. It will prevent the detonation of <a href="AttckOps.html/#thermite">Thermite</a>'s advanced explodey mcsplodey. <br />
	When should you use Mute? He does a pretty good job of replacing <a href="#bandit">Bandit</a> in terms of his gadget. Except that Mute can also prevent drones from getting as much intel by placing his jammers next to doors or drone holes to make these unavailable to be passed through by drones. His playstyle can be whatever you want him to be, you can use him as a roamer or as an anchor, although generally there are better roamers for the job so I would recommend you use him as an anchor. </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="pulse">Pulse</h2>
	<img src="def/pulse.jpg" alt="Pulse's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Pulse, the creep. Pulse has a camera that he can use to look for heartbeats through walls. This has a range of around 12 meters. He can see any attackers nearby through any walls and surfaces, it's kind of like wallhacks in a way, however he can't have a weapon out at the same time he has his camera out. His primary mission is to hold down an important room, and he does this very well.<br />
	When should you pick Pulse? I don't play Pulse, so I can't really say much about this.   </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="rook">Rook</h2>
	<img src="def/rook.jpg" alt="Rook's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Rook, Rainbow Six's other fat boy, along with <a href="#doc">Doc</a>, Rook has a pack of of armor plates he can place down (you should do this immediately as soon as you spawn in) after placing this down everyone on the team can pick them up and Rook's job will be done for the round. These armor packs slightly decrease damage taken overall, they also guarantee a DBNO instead of an outright kill. They are very powerful and should not be underestimated. <br />
	When should you use Rook? Well, he will always be a benefit to the team. Assuming everyone actually picks up their armor plates. Game plan with Rook is about 2 lines long. #1 Place your armor plates. #2 You're done, go do whatever the fuck you want. Rook works best as an anchor and shouldn't be used as a roamer. </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="smoke">Smoke</h2>
	<img src="def/smoke.jpg" alt="Smoke's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Smoke, the nazi wannabe. Smoke is equipped with three Gas Grenades, remotely detonated gas canisters that will damage and possibly kill whoever it comes in contact with. Smoke is the only Operator immune to his Grenades - every other person will take damage if they enter the hazard zone. This includes Attackers, Defenders, and the Hostage in their respective gamemodes.<br />
	When should you use Smoke? As one of the more consistent defensive operators, Smoke is a really good example of a good operator for newer players to learn. Smoke is best used to try and stay alive the entire round, seen as his gas grenades can easily prevent people from rushing into the objective. </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="tachanka">Tachanka</h2>
	<img src="def/tachanka.jpg" alt="Tachanka's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Tachanka, AKA The Lord. Tachanka comes equipped with the deployable mounted LMG that can be used by both teammates and enemies alike. With a frontal shield to protect incoming fire at the user's head, it can be used to anchor a position and block off corridors or doorways with sustained fire. The entire operator is just a meme, he is rather useless, only good thing about him is his primary not having any recoil. <br /> When should you use Tachanka? Don't.  </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="valkyrie">Valkyrie</h2>
	<img src="def/valkyrie.jpg" alt="Valkyrie's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Valyrie, the camgirl. Valkyrie's unique gadgets are three Cams, portable sticky cameras that can attach on almost any surface for increased surveillance. Unlike normal security cameras, Valkyrie's cameras are gyroscopic, making them capable of rotating close to 360 degrees and can look around faster than normal cameras. They also have a wider field of view. <br />
	When should you use Valkyrie? She's good all around, her gun is a headshot machine, albeit bad damage. The intel you can get from her cameras do greatly help though. Make sure to place them down around the objective, not in the objective as generally they're not as useful there as long as you have any anchors left.  </p>
	</section>

	<h2 id="vigil">Vigil</h2>
	<img src="def/vigil.jpg" alt="Vigil's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Vigil, the creepy guy. Vigil's ability activation is the same as <a href="#caveira">Caveira</a>'s. Except that his ability makes him invisible to drones and cameras alike while it is active, it does however leave a static-ish effect on them, getting worse the closer he is. This way, drones can still know he is in the room, except his exact location is hidden.<br />
	When should you use Vigil? Whilst his ability isn't worth the effort it was to type out "hi", his gun is really good and he makes for a great roamer. </p>

	<section id="black">
	<h2 id="warden">Warden</h2>
	<img src="def/warden.jpg" alt="Warden's Logo" height=125 width=125>
	<p>Warden, the useless one. Warden's unique gadget is a pair of Smart Glasses, special glasses that nullify the effects of Stun Grenades, Smoke Grenades, and other related gadgets. Don't be fooled however, he is completely useless. Don't use him. <br />
	When should you use Warden? <b>Just...don't.</b></p>
