		<h2 id="#definition">What is Rainbow Six Siege?</h2>
		<p>Rainbow Six: Siege is a tactical shooter. Imagine something like Call of Duty, but with realistic graphics, realistic gameplay, and realistic mechanics; thinking about it, Rainbow Six: Siege is absolutely nothing like Call of Duty. Simply put, it is a much superior game. The entire game is based around 2 teams, an attacking and a defending team. There are 3 gamemodes, secure area, hostage and lastly, the most played and most fun one, bomb. <br /> 
		There is a huge amount of operators (characters) to pick from, my personal favorites are Zofia, the Russian attacking operator, and Jager, the German defending operator</p>

		<h2 id="#community">The Community</h2>
		<p>To be fair, the community isn't the best. There are some great teachers on youtube, and a couple of really cool people on it. However, sadly, most of the community is incredibly toxic. Writing "ez" after a game, calling people shit if they can't win a 1v5, etc. It's absolutely ridiculous honestly. Apart from that, I have made some really good friends on here and had a blast playing with them.</p>

		<h2 id="newOps">Getting New Operators (Characters)</h2>
		<p>Earning new operators is a bit of a chore, you earn this currency every match, you need 25.000 for a DLC op, which are the most interesting ones generally. On average this will take about 10-ish hours to earn together, which isn't too bad, but with the amount of operators in the game, it's quite a chore to get all of them. <br />
		You can also buy currency, which is of a different type and you can buy certain cosmetics with, one operator will set you back around 5 euro, which is fair to me.</p>
